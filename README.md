Title: Graduate School Outcomes 

Problem being solved: Does a graduate degree raise long-term career satisfaction and earnings?
Using financial outcomes, livelihoods, and career success, predict the job and overall financial satisfaction for each sample in the dataset. Evaluate what patterns lead to a successful and worthwhile academic outcome when it comes to graduate school. 

Data mining techniques: 
- Decision Tree: Based on the study (https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libproxy.csun.edu/document/8987513), Decision Tree represents a solid model for Human Happiness prediction even in imbalanced datasets, yielding 87% accuracy results. Meanwhile, the study (https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libproxy.csun.edu/document/10253592) explains that post-training optimization of the hyperparameters can significantly increase the overall performance of DT. The ML framework used in that research is not well documented, so instead of RapidMiner, we will use PyTorch, a more popular and robust solution. For the hypertuning, we will use Optuna, the optimization framework proven to be valuable in (https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.libproxy.csun.edu/document/9885695). 

Pre-processing: Merge datasets, fill in the missing values, feature selection (get rid of redundant attributes), outlier detection, normalization 

Evaluation plan: 
1. Compare (pre to post)
- Visualizations
- Histograms
- scatter plots
- t-SNE
- time correlations
2. Evaluating Correlation
3.Testing the performance of an algorithm using clear metrics like F1, DR, FA on both the validation and test data subsets

Data: datasets with historical data of career-related information like educational level, field, satisfaction, salary, etc. (1)  https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org (2) https://usa.ipums.org/usa/
